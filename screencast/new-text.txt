This video introduces AI-poPro, a project focused on forecasting population changes across Germany using artificial intelligence.

Population trends play a key role in economic planning, infrastructure development, and social policy. Our goal was to explore whether machine learning models can identify patterns in population growth and decline at the level of German federal states, and how well these models perform compared to classical statistical approaches.

To achieve this, we worked with publicly available demographic data provided by the German Federal Statistical Office. The dataset spans several decades, from the early 1990s up to recent years, listed by federal state.

The concrete task for our models is to give a year-ahead prognosis of population based on the past 3 recent years' data. 

Before training any models, the data was visualized geographically. By mapping population changes onto state-level shapefiles, regional patterns became clearly visible. One notable observation is that many eastern German states, with Berlin as an exception, show stronger population decline compared to other regions. These visual insights helped validate the consistency and relevance of the data.

We also created diagnostic plots corresponding to a linear model. The QQ-plot for example shows that the residual norms do not exactly behave like a Gaussian distribution. While linear regression can also handle non-Gaussian data, this might still hint at a more complex system. Maybe a more complex model can capture the relationship more precisely?  

So for the predictive task, we implemented a neural network with a compact architecture. It consists of essentially two dense hidden layers with dropout regularization, and a final output layer. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function, with training running for one hundred epochs.

To evaluate performance, we compared the neural network to an ordinary least squares regression model. Interestingly, the simpler statistical model achieved lower prediction error. We will come back to this in a second.

Some part of the repository structure felt familiar to us from previous small-sized data science projects. We used ipython notebooks for development and python scripts for final code.
The final app is structured and published using Docker. This was a new experience to us. In the state as published, the Docker images separate data provisioning, model inference, and model storage. This setup should improve reproducibility and scalability.

Looking ahead, the most promising improvements involve expanding the dataset. Adding more years, additional socioeconomic features, and longer training runs could help uncovering non-linear relationships that the ANN could pick up on.

Thank you for watching and for your interest in AI-poPro.
