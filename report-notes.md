## Bullet points 

- changing 'code' folder to 'src' due to name-overlapping with the python module. Otherwise, a workaround for all imports from inside our 'code' folder would be necessary
### Scraping

- ran into HTTP error 429 on destatis website, occurred across devices in browser too, with VPN
